# algo-dijkstra-topsis
This repository contains C implementations of Dijkstra's algorithm and TOPSIS for graph theory and decision-making. Users can create graphs, display structures, and compute shortest paths or decision rankings interactively. Ideal for learning and applying these fundamental algorithms in various scenarios.
